JIRAtools - A bunch of tools to work with JIRA.

WARNING: THIS IS IN BETA STATUS AND IS VERY UGLY. I MEAN IT!!!

Currently this package contains a script (bin/jira-load-ods.pl) that
you can use to create JIRA issues from a spreadsheet. You can read its
sparse documentation with 'perldoc jira-load-ods.pl'.

There is also an Apache site configuration (apache/jiratools.conf) and
a CGI script (cgi-bin/load-ods.pl) that you can use to setup a web
form to upload a spreadsheet.
